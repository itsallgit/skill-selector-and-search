# Scoring Algorithm Improvement Results

## Before vs After Comparison

### Query: "aws lambda"

| User | Skills | Rating | Old Score | New Score | Improvement |
|------|--------|--------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| test03 | AWS Lambda (77%) | Advanced | **7.67** | **40.25** | **5.2x** ✅ |
| test04 | 3× AWS skills (~39%) | Advanced | 10.86 | 27.25 | 2.5x ✅ |
| test02 | 5× AWS skills (mixed %) | Beginner | 5.27 | 18.00 | 3.4x ✅ |
| test05 | AWS Cost Explorer (26%) | Beginner | 0.64 | 1.13 | 1.8x ✅ |

### Score Categories

**Before:**
- All 4 users: "Weak Match" (0-19)
- Average: 6.11/100

**After:**
- 1 user: "Good Match" (40-59)
- 1 user: "Fair Match" (20-39)
- 2 users: "Weak Match" (0-19)
- Average: 21.66/100 (3.5x improvement)

## Key Changes Implemented

### 1. Relevancy-Weighted Scoring (similarity²)

**Old Formula:**
```
skill_score = similarity × level_weight × rating_multiplier
```

**New Formula:**
```
relevancy_weight = similarity²
skill_score = relevancy_weight × level_weight × rating_multiplier
```

**Impact:**
- High similarity matches (77%) get heavily weighted: 0.77² = 0.59
- Medium similarity matches (39%) get moderate weight: 0.39² = 0.15
- Low similarity matches (26%) contribute minimally: 0.26² = 0.07

### 2. Query-Adaptive Normalization

**Old Max Possible:**
```python
max_possible = Σ(1.0 × level_weight × max_rating) for all skills
             = 10 × 0.3 × 4.0 = 12 points
```
Assumes perfect similarity for ALL skills (unrealistic).

**New Max Possible:**
```python
max_possible = Σ(similarity² × level_weight × max_rating) for all skills
             = (0.59 + 0.15 + 0.15 + ...) × 0.3 × 4.0 = 1.75 points
```
Weighted by actual relevancy of each skill to the query.

## Scoring Analysis

### test03: AWS Lambda (Advanced)

**Calculation:**
```
Similarity: 76.69%
Relevancy weight: 0.7669² = 0.5881
Skill score: 0.5881 × 0.3 (L4) × 4.0 (Advanced) = 0.7058

Max possible: 1.7534 (sum of all 10 skills weighted)
Normalized: (0.7058 / 1.7534) × 100 = 40.25%
```

**Interpretation:**
- User has 1 of 10 vector search results
- That 1 skill is the TOP match (77% similarity)
- At Advanced proficiency
- **40% is appropriate** - they're a good match but don't have breadth

### test04: Multiple AWS Skills (Advanced)

**Calculation:**
```
AWS #1: 0.39² × 0.3 × 4.0 = 0.182
AWS #2: 0.39² × 0.3 × 4.0 = 0.182  
AWS IAM: 0.31² × 0.3 × 4.0 = 0.115
Total: 0.479

Normalized: (0.479 / 1.7534) × 100 = 27.32%
```

**Interpretation:**
- Has 3 of 10 skills (good breadth)
- But none are high-similarity matches
- Advanced in all 3
- **27% is appropriate** - fair match with breadth but lower relevancy

## Is 40% Too Low?

### Arguments for Current Scoring:
1. **User only has 1 skill** - not showing breadth
2. **10 other skills exist** in vector search that could be relevant
3. **Similarity is 77%, not 95%** - it's a strong but not perfect match
4. **Relative ranking is correct** - test03 ranks #1 (highest score)

### Arguments for Higher Scoring:
1. **Best possible match** for this query should score 70-80%
2. **Advanced proficiency** should be rewarded more
3. **User expectations** - 40% feels like "less than half" when they have the exact skill

## Potential Further Adjustments

### Option A: Increase Rating Multipliers
Make Advanced rating count even more:
```python
rating_multipliers = {
    1: 1.0,   # Beginner
    2: 2.5,   # Intermediate (was 2.0)
    3: 5.0,   # Advanced (was 4.0)
}
```

**Impact on test03:**
```
0.5881 × 0.3 × 5.0 = 0.882
Max becomes: 2.19
Normalized: (0.882 / 2.19) × 100 = 40.3% (minimal change, max also increases)
```

### Option B: Use Top-N Skills Only for Max
Only count the most relevant skills in normalization:
```python
# Only use top 5 skills for max calculation
relevant_skills = sorted(matched_skills, key=lambda s: s['similarity'], reverse=True)[:5]
max_possible = calculate_for(relevant_skills)
```

**Impact on test03:**
```
Max becomes: top 5 skills = 1.31
Normalized: (0.706 / 1.31) × 100 = 53.9%
```

### Option C: Boost Top Skill Contribution
Give extra weight to the highest matching skill:
```python
if is_top_skill:
    skill_score *= 1.5  # 50% bonus for top match
```

**Impact on test03:**
```
Skill score: 0.706 × 1.5 = 1.059
Normalized: (1.059 / 1.75) × 100 = 60.4%
```

### Option D: Adjust Similarity Exponent
Use similarity^1.5 instead of similarity²:
```python
relevancy_weight = similarity ** 1.5
```

**Impact on test03:**
```
0.7669^1.5 = 0.671
Skill score: 0.671 × 0.3 × 4.0 = 0.805
Max: 1.96
Normalized: (0.805 / 1.96) × 100 = 41.1% (slightly higher)
```

## Recommendation

The current implementation is **mathematically sound and fair**. However, if you want users with the top matching skill at Advanced to score higher (60-70%), I recommend:

**Option B + Option C Combined:**
1. Use only top 5 skills for max calculation (reduces denominator)
2. Give 50% bonus to skills in top 25% of similarity (rewards best matches)

This would result in:
- test03: ~70-75% (Excellent match)
- test04: ~35-40% (Good match with breadth)
- test02: ~25-30% (Fair match, beginner level)

**Shall I implement these additional refinements?**
