# Two-Dimensional Scoring Implementation Status

## Overview
Implementing a new scoring algorithm that separates **Coverage** (breadth of relevant skills) and **Expertise** (proficiency level) as distinct, prominent dimensions.

## Algorithm Design
```
Coverage = Œ£(similarity¬≤) for each matched skill
Expertise = Weighted average rating (1.0√ó, 3.0√ó, 6.0√ó)
Raw Score = coverage √ó expertise (for ranking)
Display Score = (raw_score / top_raw_score) √ó 100 (for UI)
```

## Implementation Progress

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED - BACKEND VALIDATED

#### Backend Core (Python)
- [x] `/skill-search/backend/scoring_algorithm.py` - Configuration module created (moved to root)
  - Rating multipliers: 1.0√ó, 3.0√ó, 6.0√ó
  - Expertise labels: Beginner, Early Career, Intermediate, Advanced, Expert
  - Display scale: 100
  - Similarity exponent: 2

- [x] `/skill-search/backend/services/scoring.py` - Scoring service rewritten (249 lines)
  - `calculate_user_score()` - Two-dimensional calculation
  - `_build_user_skills_map()` - Efficient lookup
  - `_calculate_max_coverage()` - Coverage percentage denominator
  - `rank_users()` - Sort by raw score, add display scores
  - `generate_score_breakdown()` - Detailed modal data

- [x] `/skill-search/backend/api/models.py` - Pydantic models updated
  - `SkillContribution` - Added coverage_contribution, expertise_contribution, relevancy_weight
  - `ScoreBreakdown` - New structure with coverage_*, expertise_*, raw_score, display_score (optional)
  - `UserResult` - Updated fields to match new scoring
  - Removed: `TransferBonusDetail` model (legacy)

- [x] `/skill-search/backend/api/routes.py` - API routes updated
  - Search endpoint returns new score structure
  - Bucket creation uses display_score
  - Stats endpoint reflects new config (removed legacy settings)
  - Removed: All transfer bonus logic

- [x] `/skill-search/backend/config.py` - Configuration cleanup
  - Removed: level_weight_*, rating_multiplier_*, transfer_bonus_*, score bucket thresholds
  - Now references scoring_algorithm.py for scoring config

#### Testing & Analysis
- [x] `/skill-search/backend/scripts/test_scoring_and_ranking.py` - Test script updated
  - Displays Coverage and Expertise as primary metrics
  - Shows raw score and display score
  - Updated analysis sections
  - Removed: Transfer bonus analysis, old normalization warnings

#### Validation Results ‚úÖ
- [x] Backend builds and runs successfully
- [x] API health check passes
- [x] Search for "aws lambda" returns results with new structure
- [x] **test03 (Advanced AWS Lambda 77%)**: Scores 100/100 (was 7.7) ‚úÖ
  - Coverage: 40.25%
  - Expertise: Expert (6.0√ó)
  - Properly ranked #1
- [x] Two-dimensional algorithm working correctly:
  - test03 (1 skill, Expert) beats test02 (5 skills, Beginner)
  - Coverage and Expertise both influence ranking
  - Display scores scale appropriately (top = 100)

### üîÑ IN PROGRESS

#### Frontend UI (React)
- [ ] User cards - Show Coverage % and Expertise label prominently
- [ ] Score display - Raw/display scores as secondary
- [ ] Modal breakdown - Full coverage/expertise details
- [ ] Remove: Transfer bonus UI elements
- [ ] Remove: Old "Match Score" terminology

### ‚è≥ PENDING

#### Documentation
- [ ] Update `/skill-search/README-skill-search.md`
  - Explain two-dimensional algorithm
  - Remove old algorithm descriptions
  - Update scoring examples

- [ ] Update `/skill-search/docs/skill-search-implementation.md`
  - Document new algorithm in detail
  - Remove historical algorithm versions

- [ ] Update `/skill-search/docs/skill-search-architecture.md`
  - Update scoring service architecture
  - Update data flow diagrams

#### Testing & Validation
- [ ] Rebuild Docker containers (`docker-compose build`)
- [ ] Test with "aws lambda" query
  - Verify test03 (Advanced, 77% match) scores appropriately
  - Expect: High coverage (40-60%) + Advanced expertise
- [ ] Test with other queries
- [ ] Validate bucket distribution

#### Legacy Code Cleanup
- [ ] Search entire codebase for:
  - `transfer_bonus` references
  - `normalized_score` (old field name)
  - Level weight references
  - Old rating multiplier values
  - Score interpretation logic
- [ ] Remove all legacy code/comments
- [ ] Update all documentation to reflect only current algorithm

## Key Changes Summary

### What Changed
1. **Scoring Algorithm**: From single normalized score to Coverage √ó Expertise
2. **Normalization**: From "% of maximum possible" to "scaled to top user"
3. **Transfer Bonus**: Removed (coverage dimension handles related skills naturally)
4. **Level Weights**: Removed (vector search already accounts for hierarchy)
5. **Rating Multipliers**: Updated (1.0√ó, 3.0√ó, 6.0√ó instead of 1.0√ó, 2.0√ó, 4.0√ó)

### What Stayed the Same
1. **Vector Search**: Still returns top-k skills with similarity scores
2. **User Matching**: Still checks which users have matched skills
3. **Ranking Logic**: Still sorts by score (now raw_score instead of normalized_score)
4. **API Structure**: Same endpoints, similar response format

### What's New
1. **Coverage Percentage**: Shows how many relevant skills user has
2. **Expertise Label**: Human-readable proficiency level
3. **Raw Score**: Actual calculated value (not normalized to 100)
4. **Display Score**: UI-friendly scaled value (top user = 100)
5. **Configuration File**: Centralized scoring parameters for future tuning UI

## Next Steps
1. Update frontend UI to display Coverage and Expertise prominently
2. Rebuild and test Docker containers
3. Run test script to validate new algorithm
4. Complete documentation updates
5. Remove all legacy code references
6. Final validation with multiple test queries
